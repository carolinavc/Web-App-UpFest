# Web-App UpFest - React.JS Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Web-App UpFest project, a React.JS web application developed in collaboration with a renowned event company in Portugal. This project aims to bring their event management platform to life, enabling users to discover, purchase festival tickets, and manage their festival experiences with ease.

## Project Overview

In response to the demand for a functional and user-friendly web application, the company decided to partner with UpSkill once again. This time, we're tasked with developing a frontend application using React.JS, which interacts with an existing API hosted in the cloud, incorporating essential security measures.

## Objectives and Mockups

Our goal is to create a React.JS web application with pages designed based on mockups provided by the company. We aim to use React components, much like the previous HTML/CSS project, for various elements such as festival cards, concert details, artist profiles, and ticket information. Additionally, we intend to leverage the HTML/CSS structures and styles from the previous module and adapt them as needed to accommodate new functionalities.

2. Exploring festival catalogs and detailed festival and artist pages with full navigation.
3. Implementing a search feature to discover artists and festivals dynamically.
4. Enabling ticket purchase, viewing pending payments on the personal page.
5. Loading cashless account balances and displaying payment details on the personal and cashless pages. Viewing a detailed cashless transaction history.
